        <img src="images/profile-pic.jpg" alt="My profile picture">
        <p>I am keen to join the software development community and I am open to a variety of roles and challenges. I am currently a postgraduate student at UNSW in the Master of IT program which I am expected to complete at the end of 2023.

            I currently hold a WAM of 90+ enabled by my capacity for technical problem solving and teamwork-based collaboration.
            
            I have been a Naval Architect in the past, involved in the engineering design of marine vessels for operation throughout the world. I have been a project and technical manager at various times in my previous career which spanned over a decade. I have been privileged to work with and learn from many talented engineers and the pinnacle of this experience was leading the structural design of one of the largest aluminium vessels in the world.
            
            I am looking for new challenges, experiences, and innovation in an industry which I believe has a limitless runway of possibilities and opportunities.
        </p>
        <p> My priorities include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Innovation</li>
            <li>Quality</li>
            <li>Detail</li>
        </ul>
